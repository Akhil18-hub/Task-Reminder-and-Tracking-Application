# Task Reminder and Tracking Application

A full-stack **Task Reminder and Tracking Application** built using **Spring Boot (Backend)** and **React + Vite (Frontend)**.

The application allows users to:
- Create and manage tasks
- Track task completion status
- Schedule reminders for tasks
- Export task reports as CSV
- View task overview statistics

This repository follows a **monorepo structure**, containing both backend and frontend in a single GitHub repository.
